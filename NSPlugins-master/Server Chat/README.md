### Plugin Information ###
**Name**: Server Chat

**Author**: Chessnut

**Description**: This plugin allows you to have cross server communication. The plugin uses [LuaSockets](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/) to achieve networking between multiple servers.

### Installation ###
To install this plugin, you simply need to drag the plugin into your server's main garrysmod folder (where you can see addons, gamemodes, etc...) Note that there is a .dll inside (under lua/bins) so you may need to contact your host. Since the .dll has been compiled for Windows, *it will not work on other operating systems*!

Once you have installed the plugin, you will need to configure the plugin to work with your servers. Navigate to *nutscript/plugins/serverchat/sv_config.lua* which should be self-explanatory.
